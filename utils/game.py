class Hangman:
    """
    hangman class is define by 6 methods : init, str, play, start_game, game_over, well_played.
    __init__ is used to initialize the method and define attributes.
    start method is used to start of the game. it uses the game over method to deal with the case in which the player loses the game. it also uses the well played method to deal with the case in wich the player wins the game.
    the play method is used to define the main part of the game.
    the __str__method is used to display the current state of the game after each round.
